lmytfy - let me ygor that for you
=================================

IRC bot that translates some irc chatter into specific ygor commands. This is
written in C during the evening NJ Transit commuting bliss. You can't configure
it, you clone and recompile. It is losely based on the source code of sic by
suckless.org and as such keeps the same license.

INSTALL

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

WHAT IS YGOR

    Ref: https://github.com/truveris/ygor

RELOADING

    If you type "lmytfy: reload" it will exec() itself and keep the IRC socket
    opened for the following process, after the first one is done cannibalizing
    itself. That means you can recompile and reload without disconnecting...
    Until you crash it for good.
