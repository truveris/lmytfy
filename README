NAME
    lmytfy -- let me ygor that for you

SYNOPSIS
    lmytfy-irc
    lmytfy-mattermost

DESCRIPTION
    IRC and Mattermost bot which translates some irc chatter into specific ygor
    commands.  This is written in C during the evening NJ Transit commuting
    bliss.  You can't configure it, you clone and recompile.  It is losely
    based on the source code of sic by suckless.org and as such keeps the same
    license.

    There is nothing serious about that program, the http server is a joke, the
    urlencoded form parsing is a joke, the JSON string encoding is a complete
    hack.

INSTALL
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ sudo make install
