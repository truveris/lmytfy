How to hack on it
-----------------
Style guide:
    http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi/OpenBSD-current/man9/style.9

No matter what you do, the goal is not to build something beautiful or awesome,
it's to get the job done in as little C code as possible without importing any
large dependency.  Notice how we don't use a real JSON library to create JSON
or how we don't use a real http library to serve or even parse the form data.

You can copy files from other ISC/BSD/MIT licensed projects, just keep the
copyright notices.

How to wrap that thing into an installable Debian/Ubuntu package
----------------------------------------------------------------
 - Unpack the tarball/clone the repo.
 - Follow this::
 - Create the debian/ directory::
    rm -rf debian/ ../lmytfy*orig.tar.gz
    DEBFULLNAME="Lemmy Igor Zatforiu" EMAIL="lemmy@ygor.io" \
    dh_make --single --createorig -c bsd -p lmytfy_0.3.0
 - Assemble the .deb:
    debuild
